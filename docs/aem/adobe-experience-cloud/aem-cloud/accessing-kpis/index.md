## Are you measuring the things that matter most?

Before you begin your Adobe Experience Manager launch, everyone who has a stake in the project should know what your top three KPIs are and why they matter.

**The right KPIs will help you get more value from Adobe Experience Manager**

In a 2018 study, IDC analyzed the business value several large companies saw when using Adobe Experience Manager. On average, the organizations using Experience Manager Sites had improved the productivity of their digital experience teams by 23%, decreased the time required to make minor editorial changes by 64%, and increased site visits per month by 10%. The companies using Experience Manager Assets increased the productivity of their digital assets teams by 19%, shortened the creation time for new assets by 47%, and reduced the time to launch for marketing campaigns by 20%.

To realize the same dramatic gains, your organization needs to have clear goals for your Experience Manager implementation. And you need to have KPIs that help everyone stay focused on those goals.

## Accessing KPIs

In assessing your KPIs, make sure that:

1. The KPI specifically relates back to the solution (Experience Manager).
2. The KPI is closely tied to a goal that the executive team deems critically important.
3. That goal directly support a business objective championed by at least one C-level executive.
4. You have the baseline data you’ll need to compare the current situation with the results you’ll see after your Experience Manager launch.
5. The KPI will track something that can feasibly be measured at regular intervals.

Once you’ve confirmed that you have the right KPIs, you’ll need to figure out how and when you’ll report on each KPI to the relevant stakeholders.

In defining your reporting process, consider the following questions:

1. Who is the audience for this KPI report? For each KPI, make sure you’ve identified an executive sponsor — someone who will hold you and the rest of the team accountable for that metric — as well as a broader list of people who should receive regular reports.
2. How often will you report on this KPI?
3. How will this KPI be tracked? Who will pull the data? What data sources will that person or team use? Is there anything you can do right now to make that process easier?
4. What will the format of the report be?
5. How will the report be delivered?

After your Experience Manager launch, a strong set of KPIs will quickly give you a sense of whether you’re on the right track. If you’re not meeting one of your KPIs, you’ll need to make adjustments in how your teams are using Experience Manager. If you quickly exceed one of your KPI targets, that’s something to celebrate — but then you’ll want to recalibrate your target to try to get an even better outcome.
