![](/img/content/what-is-aem.webp)

Adobe Experience Manager functions as a Content Management System (CMS), a Digital Asset Management (DAM) system, a Cloud Service, and much more with extensive integrations across the Adobe Experience Cloud. Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is the solution to content complexity. As companies increase in size, they must control and optimise digital media across numerous sites and channels.

In an ever-changing world, companies in both B2B and B2C commerce need to keep their marketing materials relevant to produce an omnichannel and personalised experience. For example, a Harvard study found that 73% of shoppers engage with brands across multiple channels, and omnichannel shoppers spend 4% more than shoppers completing their purchasing journey through a single channel. AEM will help you overcome the challenges of creating an omnichannel experience.

A Content Management System helps you align your content with your customer ensuring that their journey is personalised and goes above and beyond. This is something the Adobe Experience Manager excels at by allowing you to create and manage your digital commerce experience across all of your channels with tools that make it simple.

### **DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT (DAM)**

A digital asset management tool helps you manage your product assets, such as videos, documents, logos, presentations, images, audio, etc. The benefit of digital asset management is that it expedites the process of accessing, retrieving, and using all of these digital files for your team. Adobe Experience Manager ensures that your team will spend more time making your digital experience better instead of searching for assets. Adobe Experience Manager Assets provides both smart tools and automation to rapidly access, retrieve, and use your assets across various audiences and channels.

This service also guarantees that your team is on the same page globally and is always secure.

### **PROJECT DASHBOARD**

You can manage projects centrally through the Adobe Experience Manager’s project dashboard. Every project is part of a logical group of resources and is represented as a tile. The project dashboard functionality also gives other users the ability to add information to specific projects. This functionally is useful especially for websites and assets, while editors work with external links, project information, team information, and tasks in their projects.

### **DIGITAL ENROLMENT AND FORMS**

Adobe Experience Managers Forms provides an end-to-end digital document solution that simplifies your ability to make responsive forms that your customers can easily fill out and sign securely online, making their digital consumer journey simple.

### **OUT-OF-THE-BOX TECHNOLOGY** 

If you know anything about Adobe, you know out-of-the-box is a phrase built into its mission and vision. What does out-of-the-box mean? Well, it means that many of the building blocks and components of Adobe Experience Manager will already be in place for your team, reducing development costs. In addition, you can trust that Adobe’s out-of-the-box mantra will continue, and the core components will carry on into new versions of AEM, ensuring that your team stays up-to-date.

## INTEGRATING ADOBE MARKETING CLOUD AND ADOBE EXPERIENCE CLOUD TOOLS

Companies are once again choosing suites over point solutions. While point solutions offer the best option to solve a specific problem, they require resources and patience to integrate them into your business. Marketers are starting to understand this issue. For example, research by Gartner indicates that [59% of marketers](https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/2020-marketing-technology-survey) chose marketing suites compared to 36% who preferred a best-of-breed solution. With resources and patience in short supply, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, all-in-one suites—an integrated system of tools from a single vendor—are taking over.

AEM integrates with other core Adobe Cloud tools used by both mid-level and enterprise-class merchants. Here are some of the other Adobe tools:

* Adobe Creative Cloud is a collection of tools for graphic design, video editing, web development, photography, along with a set of mobile applications.
* Adobe Cloud Analytics helps you measure the experience your visitors have with your brand and optimise experiences based on what you see.
* Adobe Target allows you to segment users for personalised website experiences.
